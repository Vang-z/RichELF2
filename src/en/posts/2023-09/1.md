### Abstract

[The Otsu's method](https://cw.fel.cvut.cz/b201/_media/courses/a6m33bio/otsu.pdf)^[[Otsu, N. A threshold selection method from gray-level histograms. *IEEE transactions on systems*, 9, 62-66 (1979).](https://cw.fel.cvut.cz/b201/_media/courses/a6m33bio/otsu.pdf)] was proposed in 1979, which segmented images by maximizing variance between classes. In other words, <a>the Otsu's method</a> is a nonparametric segmentation method that divides an image into different regions based on the intensity of the pixels. This article will introduce <a>the Otsu's method</a> in two sections. First, we will understand the principles of <a>the Otsu's method</a> by reviewing the mathematical formulas in the literature. Finally, we will implement the details using [Matlab](https://matlab.mathworks.com)/[Python](https://python.org).

### Formula^[[Wang, Z., Mo, Y. & Cui, M. An Efficient Multilevel Threshold Image Segmentation Method for COVID-19 Imaging Using Q-Learning Based Golden Jackal Optimization. *J Bionic Eng*, 20, 2276–2316 (2023).](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42235-023-00391-5)]

Assume that $L$ is the pixel intensity levels of an image which has size of $M * N$:

$$
n = n_0 + n_1 + ... + n_{L-1}
$$

$$
Ph_i = \frac{n_i}{n}, \sum_{i=0}^{L-1}Ph_i=1
$$

where $n$ indicates the total number of image pixels, $n_i$ is the number of pixels for intensity level $i$, and probability distribution of all intensity levels is represented by $Ph_i$.

Assume there is a threshold $th$, in which th is between $0$ and $L-1$, then the image can be divided into two classes according to $th$. The first class, $C_1$, contains all pixels with pixel intensity levels between $0$ ~ $th$, while $C_2$ contains the rest of the pixels.

$$
\omega_1(th) = \sum_{i=0}^{th}Ph_i, \omega_2(th) = \sum_{i=th+1}^{L-1}Ph_i = 1 - Ph_1(th)
$$

where $\omega_1(th)$ and $\omega_2(th)$ represent the cumulative probability distributions for $C_1$ and $C_2$, respectively.

$$
\mu_1(th) = \sum_{i=0}^{th}iP(i|C_1) = \sum_{i=0}^{th}\frac{iP(C_1|i)P(i)}{P(C_1)} = \frac{1}{\omega_1(th)}\sum_{i=0}^{th}iPh_i
$$

$$
\mu_2(th) = \sum_{i=th+1}^{L-1}iP(i|C_2) = \sum_{i=th+1}^{L-1}\frac{iP(C_2|i)P(i)}{P(C_2)} = \frac{1}{\omega_2(th)}\sum_{i=th+1}^{L-1}iPh_i
$$

$$
\mu_th = \sum_{i=0}^{th}iPh_i, \mu_T = \sum_{i=0}^{L-1}iPh_i
$$

where $\mu_1(th)$ and $\mu_2(th)$ indicate the mean intensity levels for $C_1$ and $C_2$, respectively. $\mu_th$ denotes the mean intensity level from $0$ to $th$. $\mu_T$ represents the mean intensity level for the whole image. Hence, the objective function of the maximizing variance between classes can be expressed as below:

$$
\omega_1(th) + \omega_2(th) = 1
$$

$$
\omega_1(th) \cdot \mu_1(th) + \omega_2(th) \cdot \mu_2(th) = \mu_T
$$

$$
\delta_B^2(th^*) = max\{\delta_B^2(th)\}, 0 \leq th \leq L-1
$$

Based on the above formula, we can find a $th^*$ in the range of $0$ ~ $L-1$ to maximize $σ_B^2$ to achieve a effective image segmentation.
